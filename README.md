## üì¶ Dependencies

To bring this fandom experience to life, you‚Äôll need **npm** or **yarn** installed.

## üõ†Ô∏è How To Setup

1. Make sure you have an active internet connection ‚Äì we‚Äôre diving deep into fandoms, after all!
2. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
3. Clone your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <forked-repo-link>
   ```

4. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd FandomFusion-Frontend
   ```

5. Install all necessary dependencies (make sure npm or yarn is configured for proxy if on college proxy, lookup [here](#Ô∏è-starters)):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory. Use `.env.example` as your guide.

7. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

8. You‚Äôre ready to explore! Access the frontend application on `localhost:5173`.

> [!NOTE]
> Commands like `git clone` and `npm install` will not work if you have proxy enabled, also doing other network required tasks will not so try setting up proxy for that interface first! (sadly gaming can't be resolved)

> [!TIP]
> To change port number for the developement of this project for mac users. Kindly refer to this article:
> https://blog.stackademic.com/how-to-change-the-default-port-number-in-react-react-tips-1a957b54759e

### Figma

First Update the designs and wireframes in this [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/design/QgTS0qjVqZKiqUT7RTH0aA/FandomFusion?node-id=42-12552&t=bAsEdvDcrrbAjLmi-1) before coding and bringing it to life.

**_This is an important step_** before pushing the final code.

> [!TIP]
> Figma app or even website might not work if SOCKS proxy is set, make sure to disable SOCKS proxy before working with figma :)
